# irisNN

Trying to learn to use google tensorflow library. Playing with seminaL iris dataset. Had Trouble reading csv data, but was resolved.

Key functions = Pd.dataframe.values which makes np array of Pd dataframe
                .pop which removes column from dataframe
                Pd.get_dummies which makes one hot vectors.
                Sklearn test_train_split which creates test and train sets
                

Rely heavily on https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/d/uciml/iris/tensorflow-on-iris

and
